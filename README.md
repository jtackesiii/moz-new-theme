# Mozoomdar at Sea

This is the digital humanities exhibit of my research on Protap Chunder Mozoomdar's travel from Kolkata to Chicago in 1893.

As of now, the journey text is provisionally finished, except the "map" page.

Archival resources will be added soon. Please disregard Archives text in its current form.

This site is built with [Quire](http://gettypubs.github.io/quire)

ToDo:
 - Fix "map"
 - Add appropriate text to "archives" pages
