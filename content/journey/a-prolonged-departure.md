At 11:30am on Tuesday July 11, 1893, Mozoomdar boarded the P&O steamship Khedive headed to London, the first leg of his journey to Chicago. According to a Brahmo Samaj newsletter, "enthusiastic shouts, the waving of handkerchiefs and the sincere prayers of his friends and sympathizers" animated the gathering of over 100 people at a Kolkata pier that morning.{{< q-note "4" >}} Unfortunately for Mozoomdar, the energy of this farewell was not enough to propel the ship very far. In a letter to Saudamini, he complains that the SS Khedive had  traveled only a few miles from the jetty before halting for 20 hours in the Garden Reach shipyard,  affording no sleep due to the heat.{{< q-note "5" >}} This was followed by a full day's delay at Diamond Harbor, the port at the mouth of the Hooghly River. It was not until noon on July 13 that Mozoomdar tasted the salty air of the Bay of Bengal.
