> The old great cataract set forth the same eternal roar, the whirlpool
rapids rolled in their dark mysterious deeps, the heavy sprays kept up
their region of perpetual showers and rainbows, and the strange noises
rose, resounded and filled the heavens. The primeval forests still,
gloomy, suggesting worship. The golden sun shorn of all his fierceness
was setting with a sad dignity, the trees were almost human in their
solemnity and awe. It was so full of God! O shall I ever come
again.{{< q-note "54" >}}

Likely excerpted from his diary, these reflections exemplify the type of
divine wonder Mozoomdar sought to inspire in others. This was his second
visit to Niagara, the first having been a decade earlier. His awe before
the falls shows that they still impressed him greatly.
