Mozoomdar arrived in Plymouth on the morning of August 16. His spirits were high. With "a strange smell in the air that reminds one of antiquity," PCM expressed to his wife how close he felt to God and his mission: "It is almost as if He is standing in front of me, the great Sage." {{< q-note "37" >}}Â The following day, he would sail across the Southern coast and dock in Tilsbury, London.
