Arriving on the evening of August 8, Mozoomdar spent two days sightseeing in the French town of Marseille. He described to Saudamini the mountain ranges, backwaters, and the "very pretty, clean, and cheerful" residents, who lack "the chalky whiteness that we find in the Englishmen." {{< q-note "30" >}} In contrast to the pallor of his shipmates, PCM had long since written to his wife of the healthful "red tinge" that the sea journey had left on his body.{{< q-note "31" >}} Although his letters indicate that he felt strengthened by the time spent in Marseille, Mozoomdar decided against inland travel through Europe to London for health reasons.{{< q-note "32" >}} Instead, he boarded the SS Khedive once again and set out toward the Strait of Gibraltar.
